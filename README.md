# Photostream

A photo sharing app that uses Firebase.

## How To Make It Work?

- Clone this repo or download source code.
- Do `$ pod install`. (_install cocoapods first if not installed_)
- Create a new project in your Firebase console.
- Set the database rules to: 
```
{
    "rules": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null",
        "users": {
          "$user_id": {
            ".indexOn": ["username", "id", "email"]
          },
          ".indexOn": ["username", "id", "email"]
        }
    }
}
```
- Enable `Email/Password` sign-in method.
- Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
- Put the file into the root of the project folder.
- Open `Photostream.xcworkspace` and add the file into the `Photostream` project.
- Modify the bundle identifier and display name.
- There you go, build and run the app. :)

## Remarks
This app is built because there is no complicated iOS app (_social media-ish_) out there that uses the VIPER arthictecture. A todo list app is not enough to see what the VIPER architecture can really do. If you have comments or improvements about it, just file an issue and let us discuss about that. Also, this will somewhat give a leverage to those who are still into Massive View Controller (MVC) coding approach. Reading articles about VIPER architecture is not enough, putting it into practice makes it more interesting and exciting. Happy Coding!
